# inferencial_statistics_project
Final project of course "Inferential Statistics"

About course:

This course covers commonly used statistical inference methods for numerical and categorical data. You will learn how to set up and perform hypothesis tests, interpret p-values, and report the results of your analysis in a way that is interpretable for clients or the public. Using numerous data examples, you will learn to report estimates of quantities in a way that expresses the uncertainty of the quantity of interest. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The course introduces practical tools for performing data analysis and explores the fundamental concepts necessary to interpret and report results for both categorical and numerical data.

About this project:

Your project will consist of 4 parts:

Data: (3 points) Describe how the observations in the sample are collected, and the implications of this data collection method on the scope of inference (generalizability / causality). Note that you might will need to look into documentation on the GSS to answer this question. See http://gss.norc.org/ as well as the "More information on the data" section below.
Research question: (3 points) Come up with a research question that you want to answer using these data. You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for. You are welcomed to create new variables based on existing ones. Along with your research question include a brief discussion (1-2 sentences) as to why this question is of interest to you and/or your audience.
EDA: (10 points) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) that addresses the research question you outlined above. Your EDA should contain numerical summaries and visualizations. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.
Inference: (28 points) Perform inference that addresses the research question you outlined above. Each R output and plot should be accompanied by a brief interpretation.

About Data:

Since 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has been monitoring societal change and studying the growing complexity of American society. The GSS aims to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes; to examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well as the role played by relevant subgroups; to compare the United States to other societies in order to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human society; and to make high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others, with minimal cost and waiting.

GSS questions cover a diverse range of issues including national spending priorities, marijuana use, crime and punishment, race relations, quality of life, confidence in institutions, and sexual behavior.
